````{exercise} 
:label: ex2titanic
Please download the titanic dataset from {Download}`here<./assests/datasets/titanic.csv>`. This is the same dataset from what you dealt with in Chapter 1 Exercises. Therefore you may use the same way to prepare the data. 

Please analyze the dataset and build a k-NN model to predict whether someone is survived or not. Note that you have to pick `k` at the end.
