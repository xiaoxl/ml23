# k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN)
This algorithm is different from other algorithms covered in this course, that it doesn't really extract features from the data. However, since its idea is easy to understand, we use it as our first step towards machine learning world.

Similar to other algorithms, we will only cover the beginning part of the algorithm. All later upgrades of the algorithms are left for yourselves to learn.
